# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs.](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)

We began with starter code which was forked and cloned so that we could build upon it to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node and Express back-end skills.

## Final Product
