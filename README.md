# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs.](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)

We began with starter code which was forked and cloned so that we could build upon it to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node and Express back-end skills.

## Final Product

- Responsive design to support different devices
- Tweet box can toggle in and out with bouncing link in navigation bar
- User can compose "tweets" and post them
- Tweet character counter counts down, if it goes past the limit it will keep counting and turn red
- Error notifications will slide down if the user tires to post something that exceeds the character limit or the tweet box was left empty
- Styled features appear when previous tweets are hovered over
- Some select screenshots of final product further down
